# AMAN: Empowering Safety for Assault Victims
### Introduction

AMAN is a mobile application developed for everyone who's ever been a victim of any kind of assault, aiming to empower them and provide a safe platform for reporting incidents such as rape, harassment, and other forms of assault. The name “AMAN” translates to “safety” in Arabic.

### Features

The AMAN app comes with several features designed to enhance safety and anonymity:

    Get Home Safe: Users can track their location after a specific time (set by the user) to ensure a safe journey.
    Safe Shake: Even if the app is closed, shaking the mobile device triggers SOS alerts to pre-defined contacts.
    Helplines: Quick access to emergency services such as police stations, hospitals, fire brigades, and pharmacies.
